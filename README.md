You can either use the `master` branch with embedded Shiny apps. Then you have to
use a Shiny server to view the presentation, e.g. in RStudio, run `rmarkdown::run()`
or simly click on the "Run Presentation" button.

Or you can use the `static` branch, where the HTMl file can be viewed with any
browser. The Shiny apps have been replaced with animated GIF images that give
an idea of the interactivity.
